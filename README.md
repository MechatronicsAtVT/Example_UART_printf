# Example_UART_printf

Features the Printf library from [Sam Lewis's Printf for MSP432](https://github.com/samvrlewis/MSP432-printf)
Also demonstrates the "doubler" state machine where if you send the MSP432 a command over UART that is "dNNN" then it will double the NNN value.  This is a good example of a parser.
